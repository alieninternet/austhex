/* 
 * Hey you! Yeah you, the developer/translator editing this file! There's some
 * stuff you should know..
 *
 * Firstly, this file *MUST* be opened/saved in the UTF-8 character set. This
 * is a requirement imposed by KineIRCd, and if you fail to do so you'll have
 * an angry mob chasing after you with torches and pitch-forks... maybe...
 *
 * You'll need a UTF-8 editor which doesn't insert weird meta-data into the
 * file (so Windows Notepad is out - sorry). One editor which has been used
 * with a great deal of success is UniRed (http://www.sf.net/projects/unired).
 * Depending on the editor, you'll most likely need to select the character as
 * UTF-8 when opening (and maybe also when saving) the file.
 *
 * The language data files generated from this file are designed for KineIRCd's
 * language engine, and therefore various rules apply. You may wish to read
 * the documentation for the language file format:
 * http://cvs.sf.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/kineircd/kineircd/doc/LangTags?rev=HEAD
 *
 * Don't forget to use whatever is considered the formal, international form of
 * your language (ie. International English over American English), and
 * include the correct glyphs to represent the words (ie. '你好', 'שלום' and
 * 'здравствулте', instead of their latin equivalents, 'ni hao', 'shalom', and
 * 'zdravstvuite' respectively). Proper use of language you're translating,
 * and its alphabet is paramount to the quality of the translation.
