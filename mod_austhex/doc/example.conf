## This is an example configuration file for AustNet. You will need to modify
## this to complete the configuration of your server.
##


## Options pertaining to your server
server {
   ## The name of your server (sometimes the same as its hostname)
   name = "city.state.country.austnet.org";
   
   ## The description of your server
   description = "Description of Server";
}


## This configures the administrative information about your server, such as
## that returned by /admin <server>. You must edit this.
admin {
   ## Administrator name(s)
   name = "Server Admins are Me and You";
   
   ## Your server's location
   location = "AustNet Server at Some ISP in State";

   ## Your contact email address
   contact = "Email - ircadmin@my.email.addy";
}


## Load language files
languages {
   ## Load Kine's language data
   langs/en.lang;
   
   ## Load AustNet's language data. This must be done _after_ Kine's language
   ## files since some of the language data may be overridden to suit AustNet.
   langs/en.austnet.lang;
}


## Listen on standard ircu ports. If you have IPv6 support on your system, and
## you compiled LibAISutil to support IPv6, you may wish to change 'ipv4' to
## 'ipv6'.
##
## For this to work correctly, add the following lines to your /etc/services:
##    ircu 6665/tcp IRCU
##    ircu 6666/tcp IRCU
##    ircu 6667/tcp IRCU
##    ircu 6668/tcp IRCU
##    ircu 6669/tcp IRCU
listener ipv4 {
   port = ircu;
   allowUsers;
   allowServers;
}

## This is the official IRC port, please use this if you can run the server as
## root, however preferrably in a chroot gaol.
#listener ipv4 {
#   port = 194; # <=- port name 'irc', as assigned by the IANA
#   allowUsers;
#}

## AustNet traditionally uses port '8888' as a routing port
listener ipv4 {
   port = 8888;
   allowServers;
}


## Load the IRC-2 registrar module
module ./modules/mod_irc2registrar.so {
   ## Send two PINGs to the user to make sure it's a real client
   antiSpoofPingCount = 2;
   antiSpoofEmail = "help@austnet.org";
}


## Load the IRC-2 user protocol module
module ./modules/mod_irc2user.so {
   maxWhoReplies = 25;
}
